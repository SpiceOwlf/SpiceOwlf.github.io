    This year, there is a huge graphic card shortcome and people cannot get their favorite GPUs anywhere. 
    As one of them, I think it is a good idea to develop a simple webpage that can take in user’s preferences as
    a wishlist and notify users whenever their desired graphic cards are in stock. In order to realize this idea, 
    I used multiple technology stacks with my team: <mark>React</mark> as frontend, <mark>Express</mark> as backend and Google <mark>SQL</mark> as Database. 
    Furthermore, I used a web crawler with <mark>Scrapy</mark> in <mark>Python</mark>, which will search GPU related data from amazon and feed those 
    to our database. The result website was hosted and presented on Google app engine.

    During this project, I experience the entire development process from brainstorming the project idea to implementing the application. As a fullstack project that 
    will be presented on an android device, me and my team used <mark>flutter</mark> for frontend, <mark>flask</mark> for backend.
    
    The application mimics the functions of Spotify. On top of that, users can upload their favorite music to our App and collaborate with other 
    users to edit and create their own music. From this project, I not only explored and learned flutter and flask, but also experienced the full 
    development process with team, which is a great opportunity for me.

    This is a package of many programming assignments that prepare me for becoming a software engineer.
    - Learned how to build and deploy simple Java web applications using both bash scripts and Maven.
    - Learned basic Java web application development techniques, which help you to work on iTrust project this semester.
    - Learned basic databases development techniques and how to use databases in web applications.
    - Learned different design patterns and realize many of them using Java.
    - Learned unit test and used JUnit to test the completeness of a sample project.
    - Learned the standard rules for coding, code smells and debugged a set of problematic code samples.
    - Used iTurst(an academic pharmacy system) as a skeleton and implemented nine user cases. Check the details at [UIUC CS427 Course Wiki](https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/display/CS427FA20/T12).
    - Tested the result with JUnit and Selenium testing, including checking the functionality of buttons, links and login systems.
