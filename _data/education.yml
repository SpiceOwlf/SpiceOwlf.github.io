    During my years at UIUC, I took lots of challenging courses that both borderned my skill sets and honed my coding skills. 
    I learned and exercised extensive knowledge over full-stack development: React and Spring Boot for frontend, Express and Flask 
    for backend, and Google Cloud Platform to host our Database as well as the server. Other than that, I make use of third-party tools 
    like mySQLworkbench and Postman to help implement the project.
