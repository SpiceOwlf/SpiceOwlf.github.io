    During my years at UIUC, I took lots of challenging courses that both borderned my skill sets and honed my coding skills. 
    I learned and exercised extensive knowledge over full-stack development: <mark>React</mark> and <mark>Spring Boot</mark> for frontend, <mark>Express</mark> and <mark>Flask</mark> 
    for backend, and Google Cloud Platform to host our Database as well as the server. Other than that, I make use of third-party tools 
    like <mark>mySQLworkbench</mark> and <mark>Postman</mark> to help implement the project.

    Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, GPA: 3.5

    During my undergraduate studying, I explored and learned basic CS courses like <mark>Algorithm</mark>, <mark>Data Structure</mark>, and <mark>Object Oriented Programming</mark>, 
    which helped me decide my career in Computer Science. Other than that, Boston College also provided me with opportunities in other fields of studying. Some of the most memorable 
    courses I took were Mineralogy, where I went to an abandoned mine place for digging Magnetite; Theology, which enabled me to taste the touch of 
    the Bible and reflect on the true meaning of oneself.

    Other than that, I managed a Senior Thesis under the guidance of Professor
     [Lewis Tseng](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/computer-science/people/faculty-directory/lewis-tseng.html) 
     on topic of Blockchain. To be more specific, we studied and benchmarked Hyperledger Fabric, based on throughput, latency and transaction numbers. 
     Furthermore, we deployed <mark>Hyperledger Fabric</mark> network through Kubernetes, Docker, Virtual Machine and Google Cloud Platform to distinguish their 
     differences in performance. Previous work, [Make Benchmarking Blockchains Configurable and Extensible](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8952155), 
     was under PRDC (Fast Abstracts Submission) submission.
